### About

GolfClashInfo is an open source collection of Golf Clash related content which was inspired by the fantastic work of the <a href="https://golfclashnotebook.io/" target="_blank">GolfClashNotebook.io</a> team.

The project was started because we were looking for a place with updated tournament, course and tour information.

Over time we want to build out the site with more content than just the basic game information.

Suggestions and direct contributions are welcome. Checkout the [Contributing page](/contributing/) for more information.
