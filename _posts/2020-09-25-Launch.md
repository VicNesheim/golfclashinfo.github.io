title: GolfClashInfo Launch
---

Welcome to GolfClashInfo. We are excited to share this new site with all GolfClash players 
seeking information about the game. The initial launch contains information about clubs, 
courses, tours and upcoming tournaments. More content is in the pipeline and should be ready soon.

We will work to backfill past tournaments to 
build a complete archive of all tournaments over time.

The site also contains search functionality (at the top). This allows you to search 
through all content of the site. It can be used as a neat way to quickly find out in which tours a 
specific course is played as well as in which tournaments a course was used.

We have many ideas how to enrich the site over time and also welcome people providing ideas or directly
contributing to the project via GitHub. Head over to the <a href="/contributing/">Contributing</a> page
to find out how you can help.
